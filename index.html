                <h3>About the Study</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this study is to prevent a serious dental disease called early childhood caries
                    that can occur in very young children. The study will take place over four years. It will begin during your pregnancy and
                    follow your baby through age three. <br>
                    <br>
                    The primary activities that will be done for the study include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Completing questionnaires</li>
                        <li>Watching videos</li>
                        <li>Short dental screenings</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> The four in-person visits will include questionnaires and a video to watch covering the oral health of you and your baby.
                    The first visit will occur during pregnancy and will only involve the questionnaires and video. Once your child reaches one year of age, the next three in-person study
                    visits will also involve a simple and FREE dental screening for your child conducted by a University of Iowa dental provider to check for cavities and collect a small sample of plaque with a cotton swab.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Between each in-person study visit we will send you questionnaires to complete online. These questionnaires will be sent out twice, once around one month after your 
                    in-person visit and again at nine months. You will be compensated for each online questionnaire you complete. Three months after your in-person visit, we will send you a short video to watch.

                <h3>Study Timeline</h3>
                <p> The "Birth to Three-Cavity Free" study takes place over four years. The first in-person study visit will be scheduled when you are between 16 to 36 weeks pregnant. We will

                    <br>
                    Your participation in this study is much appreciated as we hope to keep your child and so many other children cavity free!
