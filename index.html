                <h3>About the Study</h3>
                <p>The purpose of the study is to prevent a serious dental disease called early childhood caries
                    that can occur in very young children. The study will take place over four years. It will begin during your pregnancy and
                    follow your baby through age three. <br>
                    <br>
                    The primary activities that will be done for the study include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Completing questionnaires</li>
                        <li>Watching videos</li>
                        <li>Short dental screenings</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> The four in-person visit will include questionnaires and a video to watch covering the oral health of you and your baby.
                    The first visit will occur during pregnancy and will only involve the questionnaires and video. Once your child reaches one year of age the remaining 3 in-person visits will also involve a 
                    simple and FREE dental screening conducted by a University of Iowa dental provider to check for cavities and collect a small sample of plaque with a cotton swab.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Between each in-person visit we will send you a shorter set of questionnaires to complete online. These questionnaires will be sent out twice, once at one month after your 
                    in-person visit and again at nine months. Three months after your in-person visits we will send you a short video to watch as well. You will be compensated for each online questionnaire you complete.
